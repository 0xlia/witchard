# Cursor Rule Files Location

This rule ensures that all Cursor rule files are placed in the correct directory, use the right naming conventions, and are easy to find and manage.

## Rule

- All Cursor rule files **must** be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory at the root of your project.
- Each rule should be in its own file.
- Rule files must use the `.mdc` extension.
- Use **kebab-case** for filenames (e.g., `my-cool-rule.mdc`).
- The filename should describe the rule's purpose.

## Why?

- Keeps your rules organized and easy to find.
- Prevents confusion about where rules should live.
- Makes version control and collaboration easier.

## Correct Examples

```
.cursor/rules/
 ├── cursor-rule-files-location.mdc
 ├── clickhouse-query-best-practices.mdc
 └── another-rule.mdc
```

## Incorrect Examples

```
rules/my-rule.mdc
my-rule.mdc
.cursor/other-rules/another-rule.mdc
```

**Never** place rule files in the project root, in subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`, or in any other location.
